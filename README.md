The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course.
We applied different AI techniques to win Pac-Man game efficiently


#Search Agents
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms.
These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

#Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem.
Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designed evaluation functions.

#Reinforcement Learning 
Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

#Ghostbusters 
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world.
Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
